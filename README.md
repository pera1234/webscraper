Hi

Never have had to do web scraping before, so needed to google and came across this jsoup api.
I had a web services project already setup so reused that, and approached as though a client would be
making a request to a web service.

The client would need to make asynch requests or have a timeout for long running tasks. Could have run the
web calls an  d scraping in a thread pool.

I have added notes where I could.

Used Java 8 on Eclipse. You can import eclipse project/or maven

Please run the WebScraperServiceTest and E2E junit tests.

The BDD was implemented but not finished.

I know there will be some clean up required.

Thanks
Harnek
